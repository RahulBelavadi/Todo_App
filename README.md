# Todo_App

Thank you for considering my application for the Web Designer position. I wanted to let you know that while I have a solid understanding of front-end technologies, I am currently learning MongoDB and have a basic understanding of how it works. However, I have not yet completed my learning journey with MongoDB.

If a backend solution is necessary, I would be happy to integrate it once I complete my learning, or if you would prefer, I can continue with a simple solution using a text file as a database as per the initial task requirements.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best regards,
Rahul Belavadi
